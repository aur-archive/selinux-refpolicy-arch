# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings 
#                       instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=permissive
# SELINUXTYPE= takes the name of SELinux policy to
# be used. Current options are:
# 	refpolicy (vanilla reference policy)
# 	refpolicy-arch (reference policy with 
# 	Arch Linux patch)
SELINUXTYPE=refpolicy-arch
